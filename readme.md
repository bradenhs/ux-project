## Getting Started

View the site live here [tate-gallery.netlify.com](http://tate-gallery.netlify.com).

To get things set up for development run these commands:

`git clone https://github.com/bradenhs/ux-project.git`

`cd ux-project`

`yarn install` or `npm install`

`yarn start` or `npm start`

This should open a browser tab and start webpack-dev-server. Take a look at the code. Live reloading
should be working.
